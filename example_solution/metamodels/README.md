Metamodels
==========

EMF metamodels for the Petri net and state chart languages are provided in this folder.

Note that these metamodels include [EuGENia](http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/eugenia) EMF annotations, which can be used to generate a GMF editor for each language (or can be safely ignored).
