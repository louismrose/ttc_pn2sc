\begin{abstract}
Although transformations are already developed for decades in various communities (such as for developing compilers, transforming programs and business process management), it is relatively new to study the strengths and weaknesses from   approaches across community boundaries. We contribute to this goal with this proposal for a transformation case at TTC 2013, which involves transforming Petri-Nets to statecharts. We describe the context for the case, summarise an input-destructive approach to implementing the transformation, and propose evaluation criteria for comparing solutions to the case.
